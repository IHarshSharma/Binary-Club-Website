    <h3> This is a Thank You note</h3>
  <h4>There are many reasons to thank the seniors of Binary Club 
        Only Three of Them are mentioned below:
    </h4>
    <ol>
        <li>For recruting me as a member</li>
        <li>For Teching me Valuable lesson on How and Why should I respect My College seniors</li>
        <li>For being a perfect mentor in every aspect</li>
        </ol>
        <p>I Have a small request to make: Kindly Change the coding class timing from 5 'o' clock to Weekends</p>
        <p> Because I come from delhi and If I miss my college bus, Then I would have to Change my route to Metro</p>
        <p> Which is not just twice much costlier but also takes more than almost 1.5 hours</p>
        <p>Due to which I'll be able to make it home only after 8 'o' clock Which will ruin my scedule and acadmics</p>
        <p> Hence Kindly Change the timing of classes</p>
</body>
